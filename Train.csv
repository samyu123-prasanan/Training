Good quality video and audio...better than other dth services
No issues as of now. Need to monitor the usage for another 3-6 months
AirTel SD Box is a value for money. And the Offers provided by Komparify are great.
Its good and cool. Got a excellent package for my family containing all the channels which we were expecting.
very nice service ..and also rate of dth is much lower than market price
"very good............ one of the best picture quality. And fast service, it within 1 day i get my DTH."
"I have been using various set top boxex, but I must say that the response time of airtel digital tv is way better than others...."
It is too good..better than tatasky We liked the sports economy pack .....airtel rocks
gave best package compared to other Dth packages...
Immediate set up by after order.it take only 10hrs including night.pleasant shopping with this site.I give 5 star.best site for purchase DTH and other.excellent service.
"Airtel DTH is awesome & reasonable price, picture & sound quality is better than other dth & airtel provide recording set top box on very low price."
"have experienced- Sun DTH, Videocon, Cable TV and now I am using Airtel Digital TV, I felt really good, its the best out of all. I am enjoying movies on HD, which I felt like watching in the theater and no interruptions, the quality is so good, you can't compare with any other."
Nice to see as it has all required service. Quality of signals also have great experience
im very thankful to komparify for their amazing service and amazing price for airtel digital tv.
I have purchased Airtel DTH after a lot of research n responses on Google. A lot of negative response was there but after talking face to face with some of airtel dth customer i come to know that it is very good service provider at all I am using this last two week It is awesome picture quality al9ng with good sound and universal remote Happy with Airtel dth service.
nice working
"Good Quality . Good Performance. Lots of HD channels. Multiperpose Remote, we can use for both TV & Set top box."
"ITS VERY GOOD CLARITY AND VIDEO AND AUDIO IS VERY GOOD AND THIS SET TOP BOX IS VERY GOOD CLARITY AND ITS VERY ESSAY TO BOOK THE ORDER IN KOMPARIFY,COM AND ITS IS VERY CHEAP TO ANOTHER COMPANY'S"
i got it with lower rate than local market. Installation completed speedily.Response is good. I would like to get offers via mail
Mine is SD+ box and i love it. It comes with a universal remote too. Quite easy to use. So far no issues and works very smooth.
Excellent. This set top boxis what i was looking for. It's real masterpiece i got. I am really enjoying. Every thing is just perfect.
I had my previous digital TV whose service was worst but I am very happy with airtel's fast and customer friendly service. I love the service and offers by Airtel.
Airtel hd is best picture quality and sound.unversial remote is very nice.remote is working any direction u show till particular distance.
Excellent Features. Easy to operate. Universal Remote is very good.
GOOD. VERY NICE PRICE.NICE PICTURE. NICE SOUND.LATEST MODEL INSTALLED BY AIR TEL .GOOD .
i have never seen this type of dth in my life because its really gives a full strength of signal and witout fluctuating we are seeing marvellous channel.thanks alot
It can improve
Lots of technical faults
"I like it, but feel like there can be more options."
"Better than other DTH providers, but still not satisfied."
It looks nice and compact. We can even record programs. ADTV is using very secure NDS videoguard encryption.Remote easy to program.
"Set top box is from Air tel - standard normal one. I tried SD only not HD. IF you go with 32 inch models, better prefer HD"
Good setup box..clear transmission..nice customer service....cheaper...
The set-top box provided by Airtel is absolutely user friendly and has got good additional features like recording and remote control programming. Overall I love the whole setup and the channels provided by Airtel.
Thanks for quick installation.good picture quality. Set top box is also fine. Price is also less as compared to market.
More Facilities than cable.Good HD quality in affordable price..sure I will recommend my friends to prefer HD STB ..
"Airtel Dth provides nice service, Monthly packs available on Dth are designed as per customers requirement."
Best setup box i have ever seen. light weighted and easily adjustable anywhere in home with LED TV.
Service provided by Airtel is Good. LOL. But the service engineer who installed my set Top box charged extra than shown price for excess wire
It was very good and was installed in just 3 hours from the order.
Cute and powerful.. The set top box is beautiful and feature rich. The only problem that I feel about it is it doesn't allow remove scrambled channels.. All unwanted/unavailable channels will be in the list for ever. Otherwise I love it.
Easy to use and installation was very easy. Done on the same day by airtel
Quality of the picture is very good and it change my experience of matching TV.
It looks nice and compact. I am satisfied with Airtel digital TV and happy to recommend both Komparify and Airtel digital tv to friends.
The clarity is very good in Airtel and the service was very good.
Airtel dth was good picture quality then others. In airtel setup box their is recording facility was also avaliable
"IT IS VERY NICE AND RELEVANT TO USE , I RECOMMEND YOU ALL TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SO CHEAP TO BUY"
EXCELLENT SET TOP BOX. EASY TO HANDLE.WIDE RANGE OF CHANNELS.EXCELLANT PICTURE CLARITY.EASY TO LOT OF OFFERS.
Thanks for airtel to give such a set top box. its amazing and give good quality of picture quality
It is troubleless device for viewing system to my own and my parent.
"The box is basic with a USB slot for plugging in a pen drive for recording live TV. However, the recording is in an encrypted format that cannot be played on any other device. the nifty feature is that the remote is universal, meaning you can teach it your TV's remote signals and use one remote for both the TV and the STB."
"Everything is simply easy. service is ""the best"""
I had to searched a lot in the market for a better price. but I found it on Komparify only.
"After placed an order , we got a call within 24 hrs from the airtel and they came in the evening around 7pm and fixed it properly. Service is good. I ordered through COD ,"
Set top box is good with recording facility. Value for money. Prompt & efficient installation from airtel
its working very good and i am very comfortable with this...
The overall experience was good & device is working very well. This is a quality product...by work..by looks great
The product is good and is delivered to me on same day i ordered.I am using it and i find it good.
Hello friends I am using airtel dth in my house its working super & clarity. And the service is very good. Any issues immediately we received the solution.
good service through out the process.got installed in 1 working day.love to deal with u again komparify.u deserve 5 starts .
Very Good picture Quality Airtel Dth Very Good product experience.
Good mix of all the channels.Very good quality and pricing is also very competitive.
It's Better than other SetTop Box It's Nicely work & Clear Image & settop box feature is very good likely game & Songs
"No I using airtel Airtel.DTH having good clarity HD support ,USB unlimited. Recording it having low cost of 1700 only and monthly 99 rupee recharge. Its the best dth"
GOOD QUALITY OF PICTURE WITH MINIMUM PURCHASE COST. PACK OF HD IS VERY ECONOMICA
"Set up box is really good,But i m unhappy about airtel service and their service policy. If i m purchasing product(Airtel Digital TV) by paying in advanced ,What ever product consist of i should get it as it is. Reason to say this is My regional package is not started yet which is annoying me to call 100 times to Customer support.Even they do not support properly to answer my questions."
Hi I Purchase SD Set Top Box in Last 7 Month ago but now i changed my set box SD To HD . The Airtel Customer care Executive said to me you will pay 150Rs of Extra for Service Engg. Charge.
"Nice buying experience for the set top box. Having a few issues with Airtel, A few have been solved a few others are still in process. To add to the knowledge of all buyers, I have come to know that the price variation between Tatasky and Airtel is because Tatasky is selling the device to customer and Airtel is giving the device on rent.. the day airtel services are stopped, airtel guys will start chasing the customer to get the device back."
good quality but airtel has reduced the channel list for package. before buying plz check new channel list for package.
"So far it is okay... Moreover I have bought recently, I cannot comment on anything now..."
Set top box is good but the User interface is not good. Letters are very small written.
"Well, the complete experience about buying this service was good but i am not happy with the package installation. because i paid for value sports pack and they installed max package. i called up several times to customer service but nobody resolved the issue..."
it looks good and in airtel dth one remote is enough for both dish and tv is good
"it would have made me to shell extra money, nevertheless little extra time with komparify still saved money."
"the set top box is good nice picture quality nice sound quality good remote ,very bad service from airtel"
Customer ID was not received with product (Airtel DTH). Kindly send customer ID with DTH so that connection will be even faster.
"OK works well, sloppy even for slight weather changes. Doesn't work while raining."
Nice to use it to watch all Tamil tv channels using airtel digital tv
"ts a fast responsive set top box. Great recording features. Good speed. Note you might have to call Customer Care if they accidentally apply a recording fee, Because there is no recording fee with this device."
It's great with many features!! Recording is so vivid and clear with dolby sound quality...
it's fine
"Great set top box for the price offered by komparify. The set top box seems to be good, small and good in appearance with a good quality remote."
Airtel DTH is not good as customer support is pathatic
"If we contact customer care, nowhere i was able to talk to any customer care representative."
I'm honestly quite pleased with it
the video quality it provides is beautiful.
Not satisfied at all
Customer Care is pathetic
The bad weather message pops up on few channels Inspite of clear weather / sunlight.
Happy that I am doing away with Airtel DTH.
"My suggestion to the viewers here, that, do not opt the airtel dth. I recently shifted to jiofiber and it is quiet good."
"worst service , Durning the installation they provided me a box and it took 3 days to activate my account and on top of that the activated the account on a different name and phone number"
customer care representative are so irresponsible they don't know how to talk to a cx very poor service
"It was better than what I was expecting, to be honest."
"The service is very poor, at least in Chennai that the scene"
Please shut down airtel all ur company if u can't give customers support
If you opt for long term plan you can escape from cheating by them. Otherwise you will get stuck
I was a hardcore airtel user but from now on even if airtel is the last service provider I will rather prefer to be networkless but no Airtel. For last 10 days most of channels are not coming and they are busy charging for the same. Very irresponsible.
The picture and sound quality are pretty good
Offerings are at par with any other players.
totally love it.
"I use Airtel DTH connection and opted for the Rs 1300 set top box (HD). There was free delivery and installation when I bought it. Along with that I subscribe to Rs 245/month pack. So far, I am satisfied with their service. Even the customer service people are polite and whenever I lodge a complaint they are prompt to reply and fix the issue!"
The connection is pretty stable.
Free installation.
The customer service is reliable and polite.
The sound and picture quality is always top-notch!
"Worst service. TRAI announced that DTH or Cable operators should not block any TV channels (at least free channels), if a customer has not selected their plan. But even after that, they have blocked my TV channels (still I had a balance of RS.100 in my account). This is pathetic. And they are not worth for the money we are paying for."
Itís actually pretty great to be honest. Iíve been using it for almost four years now.
I would definitely recommend it
Worst channel number list.
Worst customer service
Airtel DTH seems to be the worst thing that could happen while buying DTH.
"Please donít go for Airtel. As long as you have no issues you will have peace of mind but if at all any issues come, then you will end up in troubles. Pathetic customer care who canít do anything..If you want peace of mind please donít select Airtel - My personal experience"
Very poor after sales services of Airtel DTH. No one will pick your call. They have recorded messages on call centre numbers. You can't contact customer care executives. No response to Email even after 15 days. Even physical store is not ready to help. It's really pathatic.
"Very good , But now a days airtel is not providing any good offers , If you donít have any pricing issues you can absolutely go with airtel Digital TV"
"The services are truly commendable and it is definitely better than its competitors out there in the market. Even when I did face slight issues, the customer care was extremely helpful and made sure the issues were solved as quickly as possible. I think itís a great investment and you should give it a shot!"
"When the warranty period was over, had to call the engineers in every 3 months to set the dish and over this had to pay 100 per visit"
So good i like it
after sell service is very bad
After service is not good all engineers asking rs 150 for a visit
The customer care support is very horrible. I suggest that no one should suffer like me.
"Even after 10 days of setup box up-gradation, we are unable to see the channels. Daily i am calling to Customer care and i brought this issue to their nodal officer. Till now, nobody has come to my house to change the faulty setup box. Since the problem"
just execllent.
"do not go for Airtel Digital, they are not interested to solve customer problems."
I wanted to have 2 setup boxes and ordered them through the help line number. I paid the money through my CC and got the transaction ID. The Sales executive told me that the installation will be done in 24 - 48 Hrs. 1 Day passed and I called the cu
"I've subscribed Airtel service, but found to be trapped now. I've gone for HD service and after one month I tried to change my channel package but still not done. Very very poor customer service."
No quick support from team.
I wish to allow individuals learn about below average service by Airtel. Couple of days back I shifted my dish on similar terrace from once place to one more as well as for this Airtel priced me Rs. 500.
The worst service provided by airtel totally money making can cut any amount from your account and no return.
"This is very very worst service. Please please never go for this. They take money by saying immediately installation can be done but days pass, no updates or no reply from them. They are hitech cheaters"
"Ever 3 to 4 months the connection goes off for no reason. This happens especially when there are crucial events being aired,"
"When we questioned the customer care guy this, he just disconnected the call and we received a msg as problem resolved. But nothing was resolved at all."
I literally don`t have any issue on it . I have been using it at my home since 3 year and its perfect
"I thought Airtel is good, So changed local cable operator to Airtel Xstream, But if any climate change also it will shows no signal, If 2 Drops of rain also get effected this connection, We need to wait till sun rises, Done big mistake by choosing this, Refered to my 2 more friends they are also facing same issues"
service is prompt and elegant. The product got installed in a short period of time and the airtel TV technician was polite and so helpful. It offers many benefits like suspending your account and formatting your pack as many times as you wish at no additional cost. Thank you so much for the wonderful service.
This app was working perfectly but now when I open the app automatically closing
Everything is fine except adding money into the wallet
"Everything is fine except that we can't see the signal strength and quality through the tv which is difficult during installation, and as for the service very poor no one was willing to come for installation of my dish I have to pick it up all by myself and call a local technician for Installation and pay him 500 extra.... The company should compensate for my loss by top up my dish"
Delivery of Amazon is good but airtel customer support is not good bcoz after installation of dth it take 3-4 hours to view channels also some channels has not display correctly. I also call airtel customer executive but no one solve this issue.
I chose 1 day delivery but product was installed the next day. Picture quality is really good ( HD channels). On my 4K TV the content is just fantastic. Good upscaling without losing clarity. Technician charged Rs.200 for installation. Still it was beneficial than getting it done from a local dealer. 1 month subscription was free. You can use My airtel app and login with registered mobile number to add or remove channels. Satisfied.
Excellent service. I ordered it at approximate 2:00PM and second day afternoon time installation work done. Before buying Airtel dth connection i was used Dish tv connection but due to poor service and negative care response i have switched with Airtel. Picture clarity is Superb. Also Dolby digital sound improved more clister clear Entertainment. I am Very Happy to buy this Product. Thank you Amazon for providing Good service and thanks to seller for quick delivery service.
"Value for money. I had enquired at Airtel customer center and they insisted to get xtream connection, on Airtel app I could see HD setup box but it was Rs 1300, on Amazon I got it at Rs 1000 for HD setup box. Product was delivered within 24 hours and free installation was done. We get 1 month free FTA pack along with setup box. Good product and good service. I recommend it."
Over all good but Installed time too let tray to purchase on your local markets and same day Installed your home
Inspite of delivery shown in 3 days the guy came on same day and installedGiven 40 rs extra for 5 meter wire Only free channel are activated but you can change the planRs 158 is added by default for FTH channelsThere options to add more channel or change packSeller service is slow
Airtel DTH are good but Technician service totally bad...
The product was good and I m totally satisfied with it. The service person from airtel for connection who comes he was also humble and in his good terms the work which he does was remarkable. Thanks airtel dth for the services and amazon for the delivery on time.
"Fast delivery but, they insatall my DTH is very let , I'm worry about their let installation, they not pick up my call also , now installation is complete but let , I'm worry , but thanks alote"

"Everything is fine except that we can't see the signal strength and quality through the tv which is difficult during installation, and as for the service very poor no one was willing to come for installation of my dish I have to pick it up all by myself and call a local technician for Installation and pay him 500 extra.... The company should compensate for my loss by top up my dish"
Delivery of Amazon is good but airtel customer support is not good bcoz after installation of dth it take 3-4 hours to view channels also some channels has not display correctly. I also call airtel customer executive but no one solve this issue.
I chose 1 day delivery but product was installed the next day. Picture quality is really good ( HD channels). On my 4K TV the content is just fantastic. Good upscaling without losing clarity. Technician charged Rs.200 for installation. Still it was beneficial than getting it done from a local dealer. 1 month subscription was free. You can use My airtel app and login with registered mobile number to add or remove channels. Satisfied.
Excellent service. I ordered it at approximate 2:00PM and second day afternoon time installation work done. Before buying Airtel dth connection i was used Dish tv connection but due to poor service and negative care response i have switched with Airtel. Picture clarity is Superb. Also Dolby digital sound improved more clister clear Entertainment. I am Very Happy to buy this Product. Thank you Amazon for providing Good service and thanks to seller for quick delivery service.
"Value for money. I had enquired at Airtel customer center and they insisted to get xtream connection, on Airtel app I could see HD setup box but it was Rs 1300, on Amazon I got it at Rs 1000 for HD setup box. Product was delivered within 24 hours and free installation was done. We get 1 month free FTA pack along with setup box. Good product and good service. I recommend it."
Over all good but Installed time too let tray to purchase on your local markets and same day Installed your home
Inspite of delivery shown in 3 days the guy came on same day and installedGiven 40 rs extra for 5 meter wire Only free channel are activated but you can change the planRs 158 is added by default for FTH channelsThere options to add more channel or change packSeller service is slow

Before buying Airtel dth connection i was used Dish tv connection but due to poor service and negative care response i have switched with Airtel. Picture clarity is Superb. Also Dolby digital sound improved more clister clear Entertainment. I am Very Happy to buy this Product. Thank you Amazon for providing Good service and thanks to seller for quick delivery service.
"Value for money. I had enquired at Airtel customer center and they insisted to get xtream connection, on Airtel app I could see HD setup box but it was Rs 1300, on Amazon I got it at Rs 1000 for HD setup box. Product was delivered within 24 hours and free installation was done. We get 1 month free FTA pack along with setup box. Good product and good service. I recommend it."
Over all good but Installed time too let tray to purchase on your local markets and same day Installed your home
Inspite of delivery shown in 3 days the guy came on same day and installedGiven 40 rs extra for 5 meter wire Only free channel are activated but you can change the planRs 158 is added by default for FTH channelsThere options to add more channel or change packSeller service is slow
Airtel DTH are good but Technician service totally bad...
The product was good and I m totally satisfied with it. The service person from airtel for connection who comes he was also humble and in his good terms the work which he does was remarkable. Thanks airtel dth for the services and amazon for the delivery on time.

"Everything is fine except that we can't see the signal strength and quality through the tv which is difficult during installation, and as for the service very poor no one was willing to come for installation of my dish I have to pick it up all by myself and call a local technician for Installation and pay him 500 extra.... The company should compensate for my loss by top up my dish"
Delivery of Amazon is good but airtel customer support is not good bcoz after installation of dth it take 3-4 hours to view channels also some channels has not display correctly. I also call airtel customer executive but no one solve this issue.
I chose 1 day delivery but product was installed the next day. Picture quality is really good ( HD channels). On my 4K TV the content is just fantastic. Good upscaling without losing clarity. Technician charged Rs.200 for installation. Still it was beneficial than getting it done from a local dealer. 1 month subscription was free.

"Fast delivery but, they insatall my DTH is very let , I'm worry about their let installation, they not pick up my call also , now installation is complete but let , I'm worry , but thanks alote"
"Everything is fine except that we can't see the signal strength and quality through the tv which is difficult during installation, and as for the service very poor no one was willing to come for installation of my dish I have to pick it up all by myself and call a local technician for Installation and pay him 500 extra.... The company should compensate for my loss by top up my dish"
Delivery of Amazon is good but airtel customer support is not good bcoz after installation of dth it take 3-4 hours to view channels also some channels has not display correctly. I also call airtel customer executive but no one solve this issue.
I chose 1 day delivery but product was installed the next day. Picture quality is really good ( HD channels). On my 4K TV the content is just fantastic. Good upscaling without losing clarity. Technician charged Rs.200 for installation. Still it was beneficial than getting it done from a local dealer. 1 month subscription was free. You can use My airtel app and login with registered mobile number to add or remove channels. Satisfied.
Excellent service. I ordered it at approximate 2:00PM and second day afternoon time installation work done. Before buying Airtel dth connection i was used Dish tv connection but due to poor service and negative care response i have switched with Airtel. Picture clarity is Superb. Also Dolby digital sound improved more clister clear Entertainment. I am Very Happy to buy this Product. Thank you Amazon for providing Good service and thanks to seller for quick delivery service.
"Value for money. I had enquired at Airtel customer center and they insisted to get xtream connection, on Airtel app I could see HD setup box but it was Rs 1300, on Amazon I got it at Rs 1000 for HD setup box. Product was delivered within 24 hours and free installation was done. We get 1 month free FTA pack along with setup box. Good product and good service. I recommend it."
Over all good but Installed time too let tray to purchase on your local markets and same day Installed your home
Inspite of delivery shown in 3 days the guy came on same day and installedGiven 40 rs extra for 5 meter wire Only free channel are activated but you can change the planRs 158 is added by default for FTH channelsThere options to add more channel or change packSeller service is slow

"1. Either HDMI or AV cable provided based on your TV input2. You can not change the channel list which is offering with this product. After the end date of the offered channel package, you can change the channel list.3. If you have concealed wiring, then you need to have a electric mechanic ready. The person who will come for installation will not insert the cable into the concealed pipe.4. After installation, the dish tv connection will start within a minute.5. The build quality of the set-top box is good.6. The UX of the menu structure can be more user friendly. Like - before opening any channel it can display whether you have opted-in for the channel or not OR while opening the channel list, it can retain the present selection so that it would be easier for the end user to browse the menu from the last state."
I really had a bad experience about this purchase of Dishtv connection. The installation was very poor quality as result programs were not clear due weak signal. Complained to Dishtv for service support and today one technician came and informed that LMV supplied was old model and even wall mounting of frame was improper and loose. Assured to come tomorrow with New LMV and set the picture quality to acceptable level. This is condition in just 3 months of purchase.
Good quality
"Every thing was superfine,prompt delivery,product quality but in a dish tv main thing is the LNB which receives the signal,it shoul be original brand to maintain best quality picture and product life. I got a non dish tv brand LNB with my order, i got a local brand LNB installed with my original dish tv connection. It should be looked after by the company to maintain its reputation."

I really had a bad experience about this purchase of Dishtv connection. The installation was very poor quality as result programs were not clear due weak signal. Complained to Dishtv for service support and today one technician came and informed that LMV supplied was old model and even wall mounting of frame was improper and loose. Assured to come tomorrow with New LMV and set the picture quality to acceptable level. This is condition in just 3 months of purchase.
Good quality

I really had a bad experience about this purchase of Dishtv connection. The installation was very poor quality as result programs were not clear due weak signal. Complained to Dishtv for service support and today one technician came and informed that LMV supplied was old model and even wall mounting of frame was improper and loose. Assured to come tomorrow with New LMV and set the picture quality to acceptable level. This is condition in just 3 months of purchase.
Good quality
"Every thing was superfine,prompt delivery,product quality but in a dish tv main thing is the LNB which receives the signal,it shoul be original brand to maintain best quality picture and product life.

This is a fraud company. I recently purchased a smart stick for INR 599. However it didn't worked and finally when I asked for refund they refused saying that it is against the company policy. This is just Gunda Gardi. In order to justify themselves they replaced my SET TOP BOX which was working fine with a repaired one saying that it is the problem of SET TOP BOX and not the SMART STICK. Now they have replaced my Original SET TOP BOX with a repaired one and I do not know till what time it will run. I am fighting for refund for SMART STICKI am planning to switch to Tata Sky or Airtel.Avoid this fraud company. Prefer Airtel as of now.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"Friends. I am from mumbai and writing my n my neighbour's experience, do not buy dish tv it's trap and I am suffering or rather getting my BP high because of it, I just changed it after more than one year and suffered for one year coz I had paid 2000 rs for a non refundable installation fee with set top box, its main issue is in every 20-25 days it gets some technical issue, and when u call the help desk, actually it's Gawar group (illiterate jerks) no one cares about you or your problem , they have 2 solutions every time one is refresh set top box, which does not have any effect and second one technical guy which is main money gainer business for them as it charges approx 200-300‚Çπ per visit.and after 6-7 months their set top box will not work and again when u call those help desk jerks they would suggest to buy new one ..so this is overall trap, and most of the time there servers are down means all channels are closed ..you just sit and relax and get frustrated, and if by mistake you call help desk then same circle continues..so please stay out of this trapFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"Since last 4 years not using dish tv. Switched to airtel. Also the account is also not deactivated in dishtv. By default it is active. Not informed also about deactivation. Not a good communication from dishtv people and customer care. I am not getting my balance also which I recharged and not using. This is very bad. To get refund of the balance, asking customer care people to recharge with rs 700 as processing fees.this is rediculeous.never seen anywhere.What I understood is dishtv don't want to make good relation with customers hence not co-operating.Very bad expericence.Never go to dish tv.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

I've ordered dish tv a year back and the product delivered to me was totally different from the one that i ordered.It was the first time i experienced like that and suddenly after that i filed a complaint which was all fruitless.They urged that they don't have the spare items that I had ordered so they just delivered me the dishtv of different model.After too many efforts and back to back complaint they finally accepted their apology.And i filed the return.After that I read reviews on different sites and finally came to know about the best product on amazon at last from where i purchased the perfect model dish tv that i wanted and I'm providing the link of the amazon page from where i purchased it at a reasonable amount so that anyone of you who are indeed need of this item can easily biy it from the link directly rather than wandering in many sites like me.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"Reliance‚Äôs Big TV is not available or very rarely available in market DD Direct carries only Free to Air channels Sun Direct have their operations curtailed to South India and though initially, they had a big advantage due to regional content, this has been greatly reduced with other companies also adding regional channels.Based on my experience I will briefly discuss each one of them- Tata Sky- Tata Sky has established itself as a premium DTH brand and is the most sought after among the urban and upper-middle class. They are known for their quality and innovations such as Tata Sky HD PVR Transfer. In terms of channel, they might lag behind a bit. Also, their packages are a bit on the higher side. Example, for English movies and entertainment channels you will have to pay Rs. 530 per month plus Rs. 175 additional for HD Access. Videocon D2H- Brand Videocon learning from its mistakes in the LCD-LED segment, has focused of services for the D2H segment. They are the only company who manage the after-sales service themselves and have not given it to the franchise model. However, they still have scope for improvement. Regarding the product, like Tata Sky, they have been a pioneer in bringing new products- RF Remote being one such product. They also have 500+ channels and services with very competitive monthly packages. However, a number of HD channels are still limited. Dish TV- The oldest player, it was once taken aback by the entrance of so many new players. However, it fought hard to continue to be the market leader. It is probably the most popular brand among the middle class due to its low entry-level pricing and with the launch of its regional line- Zing. It can take proud on its large network of dealers and maximum channels including HD channels. Service is one area where Dish TV can improve upon. Airtel Digital TV- Airtel is considered as the market leader in telecom sector not just in numbers, but quality also. However, for DTH segment, it has relied too much on its telecom brand value. While the product quality is good, it is their services which are not up to the Airtel standards. Also, they have a weak network of dealers and lack of transparency in terms of packages. Their website will give you an idea of their lack of interest in DTH segment.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
Dth services.I am going to speak about dth services if your using a cable tv then this is the time to upgrade it for dth service.it gives lots of usefulness because here you can have a channels which you need and you just need to pay for a subscribed channels or the channels you need and here in the dth there are many service providers but I prefer you to the videocon because it has lots of good option in this we can pay a bills by a dealer who will come to your door step to pick a amount or you can even pay by paytm and they cost too average iam paying around 230rs per month and you can pay the bill annually.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"Main tips on DTH operators are they enhance their quality of pictures and show most enjoyable, energetic, devotional or experienced based program on their DTH box. They have main opportunity to interact with peoples on time to time and do repairing cost free, so this changes definitely attract many one youths and old ages to use their boxes and DTH service. They also maintain their charges to show various channels on their network and enhanced their trademark everytime it to be needed. Their main aim to open many one employment as customer care executive to maintain their care services and also ad repair mechanic for every city time to time then they become on topmost network in DTH industry.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

I am user of airtel dth since Nov. 2012. There is no issue with channels or anything. But recently I faced a problem of remote control. My remote control is not working since 26 August 2017. I registered a complaint on 27 August 2017. I am calling daily to customer care since 27 August 2017 and today is 4 September 2017 and I have not got new remote control yet. And it is not like that they are giving it for free. Airtel will charge Rs. 170+ Rs. 50 for handling. Even though they are delaying to deliver remote control. I have to call daily to customer care and executive is telling engineer will visit today again next day I have to call them and again I am getting same answer from them.

"I have installed Independent TV last year in November. Till then not a single day has gone when they have provided uninterrupted service. When IPL was going on they turn off the channel in which IPL was coming. In the world cup, they have turned off all the channels. Sometimes they will cut HD channels without any notice. Then they will cut some other channels.At the top of it, there customer care service is like talking to a stone. They don't have any information, they don't refer to any higher authority who can give any information. The person who installs the dish connection, at the time of installation he was very humble, asked us to call in case any problem occurs, now when we call him he not even talk to you with respect.In short, install independent tv only if you want trouble in your life.

"I am surprised that reliance TV has 2 stars. My few friends and I have applied for this and so far the experience is worse. Channels have stopped coming and none of their nos. are working. This is really blot on ""Reliance"" brand and I personally think Anil Ambani should take retirement and stop living on charity of his elder brother. I have paid Rs. 2500 for this and so far none of the English movie channels, few of the news channels are coming but with so much fluctuation that even 1990's era cable TV was better than this. Shame on you reliance TV.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
Pls do not buy independent tv. It's channel quality is worst. Very dull picture quality. Cannot identify faces on the channels. Very few channels. I think they only have very very basic channels.

"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it. Therefore would never recommend anyone to buy it as it seems very outdated type of dth operators.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

I had purchased a new LED in my house and for the good quality of pictures and audio quality I have installed VK digital network as my set top box. The picture quality of this network is so good and looks great on led. Along with the picture quality the sound quality is also very good in this network. The service and support of VK Digital network is no doubt beest as they solve every issues and problems. The value of money is there in this set top box as the charges for the subscription of the channels are cheaper as comparison to other digital network like tata sky and others.

"I used this vk digital network when I was working in puducherry it such a worst provider I fell. first they do not provide full esantial equipment's on purchase and you contact them in order to get it, they just making fool of you they work non professionally. and after all that they charge full annual pack subscription, so worst service I thought and if you have any issue they do not take it professionally and try to ignore the problems. service and support not good it's more than worse.

I had purchased a new LED in my house and for the good quality of pictures and audio quality I have installed VK digital network as my set top box. The picture quality of this network is so good and looks great on led. Along with the picture quality the sound quality is also very good in this network. The service and support of VK Digital network is no doubt beest as they solve every issues and problems. The value of money is there in this set top box as the charges for the subscription of the channels are cheaper as comparison to other digital network like tata sky and others. So overall its a great network which should be installed in your television.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort.

"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it.

Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it.

"I used this vk digital network when I was working in puducherry it such a worst provider I fell. first they do not provide full esantial equipment's on purchase and you contact them in order to get it, they just making fool of you they work non professionally. and after all that they charge full annual pack subscription, so worst service I thought and if you have any issue they do not take it professionally and try to ignore the problems. service and support not good it's more than worse.

I had purchased a new LED in my house and for the good quality of pictures and audio quality I have installed VK digital network as my set top box. The picture quality of this network is so good and looks great on led. Along with the picture quality the sound quality is also very good in this network. The service and support of VK Digital network is no doubt beest as they solve every issues and problems. The value of money is there in this set top box as the charges for the subscription of the channels are cheaper as comparison to other digital network like tata sky and others. So overall its a great network which should be installed in your television.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort.

They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it. Therefore would never recommend anyone to buy it as it seems very outdated type of dth operators.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

When I reached them and detailed them about their poor administrations, the had begun Blaming One Another for the Inconvenience Caused. Following a Suffering of 10 days, I had Decided to Change My link Connection and Switched To Tata Sky. The Services of Tata Sky are Good and Giving Same Channels which VK was Giving At Same Prices.

"I used this vk digital network when I was working in puducherry it such a worst provider I fell. first they do not provide full esantial equipment's on purchase and you contact them in order to get it, they just making fool of you they work non professionally. and after all that they charge full annual pack subscription, so worst service I thought and if you have any issue they do not take it professionally and try to ignore the problems. service and support not good it's more than worse. I didn't expect that they are such kind of non professional organization. don't even try to use their service.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
I had purchased a new LED in my house and for the good quality of pictures and audio quality I have installed VK digital network as my set top box. The picture quality of this network is so good and looks great on led. Along with the picture quality the sound quality is also very good in this network. The service and support of VK Digital network is no doubt beest as they solve every issues and problems. The value of money is there in this set top box as the charges for the subscription of the channels are cheaper as comparison to other digital network like tata sky and others. So overall its a great network which should be installed in your television.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort.
"Last month there is an outage nearly for 7-8 days. While cable operator asked for full month rental without providing service for more than a week. For this issue I have contacted the VK Digital 044 42428282 and explained that there is an outage for week why we pay the full month rental but they asked me to pay the full rental and asked me if you want to complaint then you can complaint to any one. The guy who spoke to me is very rude like kind of Rowdy. This is the level of support we are getting. Guys please not to prefer VK Digital. Forgot to mention that he updated me ""Whether we are providing service or not you have to pay the full month rental"".Now its up to you.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

I gave complaint today at 18004197900 at 11AM in the morning and was expecting connection but when I checked at 10:45 PM no connection. Because of this worst service from Hathway most of the customers are changing to other networks. The same happened with broadband due to which I changed to ACT. Now I think its time to change the cable network too. Also the office is in second floor and there is no lift. I spoke to CC i.e at 18004197900 near about 15 times agent Yashoda and others whose names I didn't collect and with two supervisors Krushal and Surya prakash where Krushal promised connection by 12PM on 13-08-2019 and Surya Prakash promised connection by 6PM same day.

"It‚Äôs fraud company, they keep on charging extra even after paying our monthly bills, we started to pay online payment, my local LCO is not allowing me to pay online, after paying too they are not ready to activate our cable network,Initially they told 1450rs we have to pay to cash at their Iffice , after 2 days they are telling 1950 rs is balance, since 25 days I‚Äôm trying to fix the problem nothing is happening, even sent email to customer care only getting calls from them nothing has been solved till now, we don‚Äôt want to be slave to them after shedding our money, neither not showing balance in our account,What they say that we have to listen and obey, very arrogant staffs at LCO at Lingarajapuram (Vinayaka cable net) now I‚Äôm looking for some other DTH, really fed up of their serviceFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"I have taken connection in March 2020. They are not responding, when I make threat to go to Police they have given me connection after 25 days of receiving of full payment. I have struggled a lot for my money or connection.Now I have paid amount of recharge yesterday ( 06.06.2020 ) till now ( 07.06.2020) no recharge of WiFi.I m not supporter of any one but I will suggest go for any other platforms like - Airtel, Vodafone, ACT, BSNL etc any one but don't fall prey with Hathway.This is big fraud company. Please check up Google, what is there position, they are flop. Sinking Titanic.Thanks.Santosh KumarChennaiFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
"I am using Hathway Digital TV since many years on 2 TVs. To start with they didn't allowed me to opt my pack, they have signal issues every month and normal average TAT to fix the problem is around 10-12 days, their staff always keep lying and seldom picks phone. Worst experience of Hathway at Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
"Agreeing with most customers here, I myself have experienced that Hathyway is arguably the worst service provider that India has to offer. Adding to an inefficient central helpline is an all the more apathetic local cable operator who works as a local agent for the company. Thick skinned lying trouble mongers the lot of them. It would be a great public service if we could just shut down this company for good so that innocent hard working middle class people are not looted of their money! Wish I could rate in the negative!Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

"I was a customer with Hathway from the day digital cable introduced.I feel disgusted for being a customer.First: You don't have an option to recharge online.Second: You call them 10 times n they never come if there is an issue.Third: Never even dare going to their shop.I stay at Viveknagar and gad the worst of experience. My Mother who is 50+ years old had paid 350rs for a pack on Friday 11/10/2019. And for 3days she was to go two to three times a day. They used to reply, they already activated n you go home n check. 3rd day (Sunday) I went to ask the same. There were 3 morons who were drunk and claimed the server was down from 3days. I am not dumb to believe what they say. When I question the same. All 3 got up n wanted to pick a fight.I really want to sue them but then I do remember.And one more I had to add, I have heard Jio will be handled by same bunch of idiots who were doing Hathway Cable.God bless Jio with such an idiots who are worth a st..Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You!

"Gets Disconnected quite often, requested for Home shift, after 3 weeks no sign of progress, Call centre guys gives false promise. No Professional way of handling issues, PLEASE DON'T GO WITH THIS COMPAY.:{Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."
"Referring to subject its been five days still I do not have any connection. I stay in HB colony and almost I heard lot of complaints from most of the customers regarding worst response from cable operator. I have paid 350rs on 8th 12:45PM and informed the operator SVS-5star network to provide connection. Till now i.e 13-08-2019 6PM I didn't get connection. This shows how irresponsible Hathaway team is. I gave complaint today at 18004197900 at 11AM in the morning and was expecting connection but when I checked at 10:45 PM no connection. Because of this worst service from Hathway most of the customers are changing to other networks. The same happened with broadband due to which I changed to ACT. Now I think its time to change the cable network too. Also the office is in second floor and there is no lift. I spoke to CC i.e at 18004197900 near about 15 times agent Yashoda and others whose names I didn't collect and with two supervisors Krushal and Surya prakash where Krushal promised connection by 12PM on 13-08-2019 and Surya Prakash promised connection by 6PM same day. Both Leads are so irresponsible same as all agents I spoke. Evey agent keep repeating the scripts like apologize we have escalated. But no action taken. Even there is Email sent to Nodal officer nodalhydcatv@hathway.net on 10th August 2019 but surprisingly he didn't even respond till 13th August 2019.Its a very worst service from Hathway either it is Broadband or cable service, specially CC service is pathetic. Please think twice before going for Hathway either broadband or dish Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

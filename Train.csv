1491,Service provided by Airtel is Good. LOL. But the service engineer who installed my set Top box charged extra than shown price for excess wire
1492,It was very good and was installed in just 3 hours from the order.
1493,Cute and powerful.. The set top box is beautiful and feature rich. The only problem that I feel about it is it doesn't allow remove scrambled channels.. All unwanted/unavailable channels will be in the list for ever. Otherwise I love it.

1504,"Everything is simply easy. service is ""the best"""
1505,I had to searched a lot in the market for a better price. but I found it on Komparify only.
1506,"After placed an order , we got a call within 24 hrs from the airtel and they came in the evening around 7pm and fixed it properly. Service is good. I ordered through COD ,"

If i m purchasing product(Airtel Digital TV) by paying in advanced ,What ever product consist of i should get it as it is. Reason to say this is My regional package is not started yet which is annoying me to call 100 times to Customer support.Even they do not support properly to answer my questions."
1519,Hi I Purchase SD Set Top Box in Last 7 Month ago but now i changed my set box SD To HD . The Airtel Customer care Executive said to me you will pay 150Rs of Extra for Service Engg. Charge.
1520,"Nice buying experience for the set top box. Having a few issues with Airtel, A few have been solved a few others are still in process. To add to the knowledge of all buyers, I have come to know that the price variation between Tatasky and Airtel is because Tatasky is selling the device to customer and Airtel is giving the device on rent.. the day airtel services are stopped, airtel guys will start chasing the customer to get the device back."
1521,good quality but airtel has reduced the channel list for package. before buying plz check new channel list for package.
1522,"So far it is okay... Moreover I have bought recently, I cannot comment on anything now..."
1523,Set top box is good but the User interface is not good. Letters are very small written.
1524,"Well, the complete experience about buying this service was good but i am not happy with the package installation. because i paid for value sports pack and they installed max package. i called up several times to customer service but nobody resolved the issue..."
1525,it looks good and in airtel dth one remote is enough for both dish and tv is good
1526,"it would have made me to shell extra money, nevertheless little extra time with komparify still saved money."
1527,"the set top box is good nice picture quality nice sound quality good remote ,very bad service from airtel"
1528,Customer ID was not received with product (Airtel DTH). Kindly send customer ID with DTH so that connection will be even faster.
1529,"OK works well, sloppy even for slight weather changes. Doesn't work while raining."
1530,Nice to use it to watch all Tamil tv channels using airtel digital tv
1531,"ts a fast responsive set top box. Great recording features. Good speed. Note you might have to call Customer Care if they accidentally apply a recording fee, Because there is no recording fee with this device."
1532,It's great with many features!! Recording is so vivid and clear with dolby sound quality...
1533,it's fine
1534,"Great set top box for the price offered by komparify. The set top box seems to be good, small and good in appearance with a good quality remote."
1535,Airtel DTH is not good as customer support is pathatic
1536,"If we contact customer care, nowhere i was able to talk to any customer care representative."
1537,I'm honestly quite pleased with it
1538,the video quality it provides is beautiful.
1539,Not satisfied at all
1540,Customer Care is pathetic
1541,The bad weather message pops up on few channels Inspite of clear weather / sunlight.
1542,Happy that I am doing away with Airtel DTH.
1543,"My suggestion to the viewers here, that, do not opt the airtel dth. I recently shifted to jiofiber and it is quiet good."
1544,"worst service , Durning the installation they provided me a box and it took 3 days to activate my account and on top of that the activated the account on a different name and phone number"
1545,customer care representative are so irresponsible they don't know how to talk to a cx very poor service
1546,"It was better than what I was expecting, to be honest."
1547,"The service is very poor, at least in Chennai that the scene"
1548,Please shut down airtel all ur company if u can't give customers support
1549,If you opt for long term plan you can escape from cheating by them. Otherwise you will get stuck
1550,I was a hardcore airtel user but from now on even if airtel is the last service provider I will rather prefer to be networkless but no Airtel. For last 10 days most of channels are not coming and they are busy charging for the same. Very irresponsible.
1551,The picture and sound quality are pretty good
1552,Offerings are at par with any other players.
1553,totally love it.
1554,"I use Airtel DTH connection and opted for the Rs 1300 set top box (HD). There was free delivery and installation when I bought it. Along with that I subscribe to Rs 245/month pack. So far, I am satisfied with their service. Even the customer service people are polite and whenever I lodge a complaint they are prompt to reply and fix the issue!"
1555,The connection is pretty stable.
1556,Free installation.
1557,The customer service is reliable and polite.
1558,The sound and picture quality is always top-notch!
1559,"Worst service. TRAI announced that DTH or Cable operators should not block any TV channels (at least free channels), if a customer has not selected their plan. But even after that, they have blocked my TV channels (still I had a balance of RS.100 in my account). This is pathetic. And they are not worth for the money we are paying for."
1560,Itís actually pretty great to be honest. Iíve been using it for almost four years now.
1561,I would definitely recommend it
1562,Worst channel number list.
1563,Worst customer service
1564,Airtel DTH seems to be the worst thing that could happen while buying DTH.
1565,"Please donít go for Airtel. As long as you have no issues you will have peace of mind but if at all any issues come, then you will end up in troubles. Pathetic customer care who canít do anything..If you want peace of mind please donít select Airtel - My personal experience"
1566,Very poor after sales services of Airtel DTH. No one will pick your call. They have recorded messages on call centre numbers. You can't contact customer care executives. No response to Email even after 15 days. Even physical store is not ready to help. It's really pathatic.
1567,"Very good , But now a days airtel is not providing any good offers , If you donít have any pricing issues you can absolutely go with airtel Digital TV"
1568,"The services are truly commendable and it is definitely better than its competitors out there in the market. Even when I did face slight issues, the customer care was extremely helpful and made sure the issues were solved as quickly as possible. I think itís a great investment and you should give it a shot!"
1569,"When the warranty period was over, had to call the engineers in every 3 months to set the dish and over this had to pay 100 per visit"
1570,So good i like it
1571,after sell service is very bad
1572,After service is not good all engineers asking rs 150 for a visit
1573,The customer care support is very horrible. I suggest that no one should suffer like me.
1574,"Even after 10 days of setup box up-gradation, we are unable to see the channels. Daily i am calling to Customer care and i brought this issue to their nodal officer. Till now, nobody has come to my house to change the faulty setup box. Since the problem"
1575,just execllent.
1576,"do not go for Airtel Digital, they are not interested to solve customer problems."
1577,I wanted to have 2 setup boxes and ordered them through the help line number. I paid the money through my CC and got the transaction ID. The Sales executive told me that the installation will be done in 24 - 48 Hrs. 1 Day passed and I called the cu
1578,"I've subscribed Airtel service, but found to be trapped now. I've gone for HD service and after one month I tried to change my channel package but still not done. Very very poor customer service."
1579,No quick support from team.
1580,I wish to allow individuals learn about below average service by Airtel. Couple of days back I shifted my dish on similar terrace from once place to one more as well as for this Airtel priced me Rs. 500.
1581,The worst service provided by airtel totally money making can cut any amount from your account and no return.
1582,"This is very very worst service. Please please never go for this. They take money by saying immediately installation can be done but days pass, no updates or no reply from them. They are hitech cheaters"
1583,"Ever 3 to 4 months the connection goes off for no reason. This happens especially when there are crucial events being aired,"
1584,"When we questioned the customer care guy this, he just disconnected the call and we received a msg as problem resolved. But nothing was resolved at all."
1585,I literally don`t have any issue on it . I have been using it at my home since 3 year and its perfect
1586,"I thought Airtel is good, So changed local cable operator to Airtel Xstream, But if any climate change also it will shows no signal, If 2 Drops of rain also get effected this connection, We need to wait till sun rises, Done big mistake by choosing this, Refered to my 2 more friends they are also facing same issues"
1587,service is prompt and elegant. The product got installed in a short period of time and the airtel TV technician was polite and so helpful. It offers many benefits like suspending your account and formatting your pack as many times as you wish at no additional cost. Thank you so much for the wonderful service.
1588,This app was working perfectly but now when I open the app automatically closing
1589,Everything is fine except adding money into the wallet
1590,"Everything is fine except that we can't see the signal strength and quality through the tv which is difficult during installation, and as for the service very poor no one was willing to come for installation of my dish I have to pick it up all by myself and call a local technician for Installation and pay him 500 extra.... The company should compensate for my loss by top up my dish"
1591,Delivery of Amazon is good but airtel customer support is not good bcoz after installation of dth it take 3-4 hours to view channels also some channels has not display correctly. I also call airtel customer executive but no one solve this issue.
1592,I chose 1 day delivery but product was installed the next day. Picture quality is really good ( HD channels). On my 4K TV the content is just fantastic. Good upscaling without losing clarity. Technician charged Rs.200 for installation. Still it was beneficial than getting it done from a local dealer. 1 month subscription was free. You can use My airtel app and login with registered mobile number to add or remove channels. Satisfied.
1593,Excellent service. I ordered it at approximate 2:00PM and second day afternoon time installation work done. Before buying Airtel dth connection i was used Dish tv connection but due to poor service and negative care response i have switched with Airtel. Picture clarity is Superb. Also Dolby digital sound improved more clister clear Entertainment. I am Very Happy to buy this Product. Thank you Amazon for providing Good service and thanks to seller for quick delivery service.
1594,"Value for money. I had enquired at Airtel customer center and they insisted to get xtream connection, on Airtel app I could see HD setup box but it was Rs 1300, on Amazon I got it at Rs 1000 for HD setup box. Product was delivered within 24 hours and free installation was done. We get 1 month free FTA pack along with setup box. Good product and good service. I recommend it."
1595,Over all good but Installed time too let tray to purchase on your local markets and same day Installed your home
1596,Inspite of delivery shown in 3 days the guy came on same day and installedGiven 40 rs extra for 5 meter wire Only free channel are activated but you can change the planRs 158 is added by default for FTH channelsThere options to add more channel or change packSeller service is slow
1597,Airtel DTH are good but Technician service totally bad...
1598,The product was good and I m totally satisfied with it. The service person from airtel for connection who comes he was also humble and in his good terms the work which he does was remarkable. Thanks airtel dth for the services and amazon for the delivery on time.
1599,"Fast delivery but, they insatall my DTH is very let , I'm worry about their let installation, they not pick up my call also , now installation is complete but let , I'm worry , but thanks alote"

Assured to come tomorrow with New LMV and set the picture quality to acceptable level. This is condition in just 3 months of purchase.

Complained to Dishtv for service support and today one technician came and informed that LMV supplied was old model and even wall mounting of frame was improper and loose. Assured to come tomorrow with New LMV and set the picture quality to acceptable level. This is condition in just 3 months of purchase.

2233,"Reliance‚Äôs Big TV is not available or very rarely available in market DD Direct carries only Free to Air channels Sun Direct have their operations curtailed to South India and though initially, they had a big advantage due to regional content, this has been greatly reduced with other companies also adding regional channels.Based on my experience I will briefly discuss each one of them- Tata Sky- Tata Sky has established itself as a premium DTH brand and is the most sought after among the urban and upper-middle class. They are known for their quality and innovations such as Tata Sky HD PVR Transfer. In terms of channel, they might lag behind a bit. Also, their packages are a bit on the higher side. Example, for English movies and entertainment channels you will have to pay Rs. 530 per month plus Rs. 175 additional for HD Access. Videocon D2H- Brand Videocon learning from its mistakes in the LCD-LED segment, has focused of services for the D2H segment. They are the only company who manage the after-sales service themselves and have not given it to the franchise model. However, they still have scope for improvement. Regarding the product, like Tata Sky, they have been a pioneer in bringing new products- RF Remote being one such product. They also have 500+ channels and services with very competitive monthly packages. However, a number of HD channels are still limited. Dish TV- The oldest player, it was once taken aback by the entrance of so many new players. However, it fought hard to continue to be the market leader. It is probably the most popular brand among the middle class due to its low entry-level pricing and with the launch of its regional line- Zing. It can take proud on its large network of dealers and maximum channels including HD channels. Service is one area where Dish TV can improve upon. Airtel Digital TV- Airtel is considered as the market leader in telecom sector not just in numbers, but quality also. However, for DTH segment, it has relied too much on its telecom brand value. While the product quality is good, it is their services which are not up to the Airtel standards. Also, they have a weak network of dealers and lack of transparency in terms of packages. Their website will give you an idea of their lack of interest in DTH segment.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

They don't have any information, they don't refer to any higher authority who can give any information.

2281,"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it. Therefore would never recommend anyone to buy it as it seems very outdated type of dth operators.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk Thank You! We appreciate your effort."

2300,"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it.

2357,"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it.

2414,"VK Digital Network is new in the field of DTH Operators. I just wanted to review that that just because I used is very earlier.I would like to start with its major problem which is THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS DTH. One could simply say no this sevice provider after using it a while. This DTH is NOT IDEAL FOR HD TVs. Because the picture quality is very poor and if we use them in Above 32'inch Screen, then we would find that picture quality gets worst. They are only ideal for those who are still using CRT TVs but it is never recommended for earlier TVs.Another thing which annoys an user a lot is the SIGNAL ISSUES by which one have to face interruption. This also the main problem of this DTH Operator. Signal strength is very low and I also think that this can also be the major issue behind poor picture quality.Because of these issues, I think that its not a right choice for those who are thinking to buy it.
